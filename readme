This is my first "complete" game.

Controls are as follows:

	W to move up

	A to move left

	S to move down

	D to move right

	Clicking the mouse will fire a bullet in that direction

your character is the sphere with a blue cross.

The objective of the game is to avoid the spheres with a red cross.

If spheres with red crosses collide, they will destroy each other and you will get a score.
